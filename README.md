## Introduction ##

dlisio is an LGPL licensed library for working with well logs in Digital Log
Interchange Standard (DLIS V1), also known as
[RP66 V1](http://w3.energistics.org/rp66/v1/Toc/main.html). DLIS V2 is
out-of-scope for this project, as it is quite different and hardly in use in
the industry. It is an attempt at a powerful community-driven, portable,
easy-to-use and flexible library for well logs, that can be used to build a
wide array of applications.

As of version 0.3.0, dlisio is extended to also read Log Information Standard 79
([LIS79](http://w3.energistics.org/LIS/lis-79.pdf)). An extended version of the
LIS79 standard called LIS84/Enhanced LIS exists, but this version is currently
not supported by dlisio. Please note that the LIS reader is experimental and
lacks the same thorough testing and real world experience as the DLIS reader.

Features are added as they are needed; suggestions, defect reports, and
contributions of all kinds are very welcome.

## Getting started ##

dlisio is in rapid development, and the interfaces are *not* stable. We welcome
any users and will try our best to accomodate your needs, but we currently make
no guarantees that code that works today will work tomorrow.

### Get dlisio ###

The end-user should go through the python library, as the core library is
intended for developers only. The pre-built alpha releases are available
through [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/dlisio/)

```bash
pip3 install dlisio
```

Once dlisio is stable it will also be available as debian, fedora, and conda
packages.

### Build dlisio ###

To develop dlisio, or to build a particular revision from source, you need:

* A C++11 compatible compiler (tested daily on gcc, clang, and msvc 2015)
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/) version 3.5 or greater
* [Python](https://python.org) version 3.6 or greater
* [fmtlib](http://fmtlib.net/) tested mainly with 5.3.0
* [mpark_variant](https://github.com/mpark/variant)
* [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) version 2.6 or greater
* [setuptools](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools) version 28 or greater
* [layered-file-protocols](https://github.com/equinor/layered-file-protocols)
* python packages pytest, pytest-runner, and numpy

If you do not have pybind11 installed on your system, the easiest way to get a
working copy is to `pip3 install pybind11` (NP! pybind11, not pybind)

layered-file-protocols has to be installed from source if you don't already
have it on your system:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/equinor/layered-file-protocols.git
mkdir layered-file-protocols/build
cd layered-file-protocols/build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON
-DLFP_FMT_HEADER_ONLY=ON
make
make install
```

To then build and install dlisio:

```bash
mkdir dlisio/build
cd dlisio/build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON
make
```

dlisio follows common cmake rules and conventions, e.g. to set install prefix
use `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`. To build the python library it is usually a good
idea to build shared libraries. To disable python, pass `-DBUILD_PYTHON=OFF`.
By default, the python library is built.

## Tutorial ##

dlisio's documentation is hosted on
[readthedocs](https://dlisio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). Please refer there for
proper introduction to dlisio, and the file-formats DLIS and LIS. With dlisio
it is easy to read the curve-data from DLIS-files:

```python
from dlisio import dlis

with dlis.load('myfile.dlis') as files:
    for f in files:
        for frame in f.frames:
            curves = f.curves()
            # Do something with the curves

```
and from LIS-files:

```python
from dlisio import lis

with lis.load('myfile.lis') as files:
    for f in files:
        for format_spec in f.data_format_specs:
            curves = lis.curves(f, format_spec)
            # Do something with the curves
```

In both cases the curves are returned as [structured
numpy.ndarray](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.rec.html) with the
curve mnemonics as field names (column names).

## Contributing ##

We welcome all kinds of contributions, including code, bug reports, issues,
feature requests, and documentation. The preferred way of submitting a
contribution is to either make an
[issue](https://github.com/equinor/dlisio/issues) on github or by forking the
project on github and making a pull request.
